In this and the next few videos, I want to tell you about a machine learning application example, or a machine learning application history centered around an application called Photo OCR  . There are three reasons why I want to do this, first I wanted to show you an example of how a complex machine learning system can be put together. Second, once told the concepts of a machine learning a type line and how to allocate resources when you're trying to decide what to do next. And this can either be in the context of you working by yourself on the big application Or it can be the context of a team of developers trying to build a complex application together. And then finally, the Photo OCR problem also gives me an excuse to tell you about just a couple more interesting ideas for machine learning. One is some ideas of how to apply machine learning to computer vision problems, and second is the idea of artificial data synthesis, which we'll see in a couple of videos. So, let's start by talking about what is the Photo OCR problem. Photo OCR stands for Photo Optical Character Recognition. With the growth of digital photography and more recently the growth of camera in our cell phones we now have tons of visual pictures that we take all over the place. And one of the things that has interested many developers is how to get our computers to understand the content of these pictures a little bit better. The photo OCR problem focuses on how to get computers to read the text to the purest in images that we take. Given an image like this it might be nice if a computer can read the text in this image so that if you're trying to look for this picture again you type in the words, lulu bees and and have it automatically pull up this picture, so that you're not spending lots of time digging through your photo collection Maybe hundreds of thousands of pictures in. The Photo OCR problem does exactly this, and it does so in several steps. First, given the picture it has to look through the image and detect where there is text in the picture. And after it has done that or if it successfully does that it then has to look at these text regions and actually read the text in those regions, and hopefully if it reads it correctly, it'll come up with these transcriptions of what is the text that appears in the image. Whereas OCR, or optical character recognition of scanned documents is relatively easier problem, doing OCR from photographs today is still a very difficult machine learning problem, and you can do this. Not only can this help our computers to understand the content of our though images better, there are also applications like helping blind people, for example, if you could provide to a blind person a camera that can look at what's in front of them, and just tell them the words that my be on the street sign in front of them. With car navigation systems. For example, imagine if your car could read the street signs and help you navigate to your destination. In order to perform photo OCR, here's what we can do. First we can go through the image and find the regions where there's text and image. So, shown here is one example of text and image that the photo OCR system may find. Second, given the rectangle around that text region, we can then do character segmentation, where we might take this text box that says "Antique Mall" and try to segment it out into the locations of the individual characters. And finally, having segmented out into individual characters, we can then run a crossfire, which looks at the images of the visual characters, and tries to figure out the first character's an A, the second character's an N, the third character is a T, and so on, so that up by doing all this how that hopefully you can then figure out that this phrase is Rulegee's antique mall and similarly for some of the other words that appear in that image. I should say that there are some photo OCR systems that do even more complex things, like a bit of spelling correction at the end. So if, for example, your character segmentation and character classification system tells you that it sees the word c 1 e a n i n g. Then, you know, a sort of spelling correction system might tell you that this is probably the word 'cleaning', and your character classification algorithm had just mistaken the l for a 1. But for the purpose of what we want to do in this video, let's ignore this last step and just focus on the system that does these three steps of text detection, character segmentation, and character classification. A system like this is what we call a machine learning pipeline. In particular, here's a picture showing the photo OCR pipeline. We have an image, which then fed to the text detection system text regions, we then segment out the characters--the individual characters in the text--and then finally we recognize the individual characters. In many complex machine learning systems, these sorts of pipelines are common, where you can have multiple modules--in this example, the text detection, character segmentation, character recognition modules--each of which may be machine learning component, or sometimes it may not be a machine learning component but to have a set of modules that act one after another on some piece of data in order to produce the output you want, which in the photo OCR example is to find the transcription of the text that appeared in the image. If you're designing a machine learning system one of the most important decisions will often be what exactly is the pipeline that you want to put together. In other words, given the photo OCR problem, how do you break this problem down into a sequence of different modules. And you design the pipeline and each the performance of each of the modules in your pipeline. will often have a big impact on the final performance of your algorithm. If you have a team of engineers working on a problem like this is also very common to have different individuals work on different modules. So I could easily imagine tech easily being the of anywhere from 1 to 5 engineers, character segmentation maybe another 1-5 engineers, and character recognition being another 1-5 engineers, and so having a pipeline like often offers a natural way to divide up the workload amongst different members of an engineering team, as well. Although, or course, all of this work could also be done by just one person if that's how you want to do it. In complex machine learning systems the idea of a pipeline, of a machine of a pipeline, is pretty pervasive. And what you just saw is a specific example of how a Photo OCR pipeline might work. In the next few videos I'll tell you a little bit more about this pipeline, and we'll continue to use this as an example to illustrate--I think--a few more key concepts of machine learning.
