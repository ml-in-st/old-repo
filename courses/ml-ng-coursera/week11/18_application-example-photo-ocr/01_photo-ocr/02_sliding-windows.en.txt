In the previous video, we talked about the photo OCR pipeline and how that worked. In which we would take an image and pass the Through a sequence of machine learning components in order to try to read the text that appears in an image. In this video I like to. A little bit more about how the individual components of the pipeline works. In particular most of this video will center around the discussion. of whats called a sliding windows. The first stage of the filter was the Text detection where we look at an image like this and try to find the regions of text that appear in this image. Text detection is an unusual problem in computer vision. Because depending on the length of the text you're trying to find, these rectangles that you're trying to find can have different aspect. So in order to talk about detecting things in images let's start with a simpler example of pedestrian detection and we'll then later go back to. Ideas that were developed in pedestrian detection and apply them to text detection. So in pedestrian detection you want to take an image that looks like this and the whole idea is the individual pedestrians that appear in the image. So there's one pedestrian that we found, there's a second one, a third one a fourth one, a fifth one. And a one. This problem is maybe slightly simpler than text detection just for the reason that the aspect ratio of most pedestrians are pretty similar. Just using a fixed aspect ratio for these rectangles that we're trying to find. So by aspect ratio I mean the ratio between the height and the width of these rectangles. They're all the same. for different pedestrians but for text detection the height and width ratio is different for different lines of text Although for pedestrian detection, the pedestrians can be different distances away from the camera and so the height of these rectangles can be different depending on how far away they are. but the aspect ratio is the same. In order to build a pedestrian detection system here's how you can go about it. Let's say that we decide to standardize on this aspect ratio of 82 by 36 and we could have chosen some rounded number like 80 by 40 or something, but 82 by 36 seems alright. What we would do is then go out and collect large training sets of positive and negative examples. Here are examples of 82 X 36 image patches that do contain pedestrians and here are examples of images that do not. On this slide I show 12 positive examples of y1 and 12 examples of y0. In a more typical pedestrian detection application, we may have anywhere from a 1,000 training examples up to maybe 10,000 training examples, or even more if you can get even larger training sets. And what you can do, is then train in your network or some other learning algorithm to take this input, an MS patch of dimension 82 by 36, and to classify  'y' and to classify that image patch as either containing a pedestrian or not. So this gives you a way of applying supervised learning in order to take an image patch can determine whether or not a pedestrian appears in that image capture. Now, lets say we get a new image, a test set image like this and we want to try to find a pedestrian's picture image. What we would do is start by taking a rectangular patch of this image. Like that shown up here, so that's maybe a 82 X 36 patch of this image, and run that image patch through our classifier to determine whether or not there is a pedestrian in that image patch, and hopefully our classifier will return y equals 0 for that patch, since there is no pedestrian. Next, we then take that green rectangle and we slide it over a bit and then run that new image patch through our classifier to decide if there's a pedestrian there. And having done that, we then slide the window further to the right and run that patch through the classifier again. The amount by which you shift the rectangle over each time is a parameter, that's sometimes called the step size of the parameter, sometimes also called the slide parameter, and if you step this one pixel at a time. So you can use the step size or stride of 1, that usually performs best, that is more cost effective, and so using a step size of maybe 4 pixels at a time, or eight pixels at a time or some large number of pixels might be more common, since you're then moving the rectangle a little bit more each time. So, using this process, you continue stepping the rectangle over to the right a bit at a time and running each of these patches through a classifier, until eventually, as you slide this window over the different locations in the image, first starting with the first row and then we go further rows in the image, you would then run all of these different image patches at some step size or some stride through your classifier. Now, that was a pretty small rectangle, that would only detect pedestrians of one specific size. What we do next is start to look at larger image patches. So now let's take larger images patches, like those shown here and run those through the crossfire as well. And by the way when I say take a larger image patch, what I really mean is when you take an image patch like this, what you're really doing is taking that image patch, and resizing it down to 82 X 36, say. So you take this larger patch and re-size it to be smaller image and then it would be the smaller size image that is what you would pass through your classifier to try and decide if there is a pedestrian in that patch. And finally you can do this at an even larger scales and run that side of Windows to the end And after this whole process hopefully your algorithm will detect whether theres pedestrian appears in the image, so thats how you train a the classifier, and then use a sliding windows classifier, or use a sliding windows detector in order to find pedestrians in the image. Let's have a turn to the text detection example and talk about that stage in our photo OCR pipeline, where our goal is to find the text regions in unit. similar to pedestrian detection you can come up with a label training set with positive examples and negative examples with examples corresponding to regions where text appears. So instead of trying to detect pedestrians, we're now trying to detect texts. And so positive examples are going to be patches of images where there is text. And negative examples is going to be patches of images where there isn't text. Having trained this we can now apply it to a new image, into a test set image. So here's the image that we've been using as example. Now, last time we run, for this example we are going to run a sliding windows at just one fixed scale just for purpose of illustration, meaning that I'm going to use just one rectangle size. But lets say I run my little sliding windows classifier on lots of little image patches like this if I do that, what Ill end up with is a result like this where the white region show where my text detection system has found text and so the axis' of these two figures are the same. So there is a region up here, of course also a region up here, so the fact that this black up here represents that the classifier does not think it's found any texts up there, whereas the fact that there's a lot of white stuff here, that reflects that classifier thinks that it's found a bunch of texts. over there on the image. What i have done on this image on the lower left is actually use white to show where the classifier thinks it has found text. And different shades of grey correspond to the probability that was output by the classifier, so like the shades of grey corresponds to where it thinks it might have found text but has lower confidence the bright white response to whether the classifier, up with a very high probability, estimated probability of there being pedestrians in that location. We aren't quite done yet because what we actually want to do is draw rectangles around all the region where this text in the image, so were going to take one more step which is we take the output of the classifier and apply to it what is called an expansion operator. So what that does is, it take the image here, and it takes each of the white blobs, it takes each of the white regions and it expands that white region. Mathematically, the way you implement that is, if you look at the image on the right, what we're doing to create the image on the right is, for every pixel we are going to ask, is it withing some distance of a white pixel in the left image. And so, if a specific pixel is within, say, five pixels or ten pixels of a white pixel in the leftmost image, then we'll also color that pixel white in the rightmost image. And so, the effect of this is, we'll take each of the white blobs in the leftmost image and expand them a bit, grow them a little bit, by seeing whether the nearby pixels, the white pixels, and then coloring those nearby pixels in white as well. Finally, we are just about done. We can now look at this right most image and just look at the connecting components and look at the as white regions and draw bounding boxes around them. And in particular, if we look at all the white regions, like this one, this one, this one, and so on, and if we use a simple heuristic to rule out rectangles whose aspect ratios look funny because we know that boxes around text should be much wider than they are tall. And so if we ignore the thin, tall blobs like this one and this one, and we discard these ones because they are too tall and thin, and we then draw a the rectangles around the ones whose aspect ratio thats a height to what ratio looks like for text regions, then we can draw rectangles, the bounding boxes around this text region, this text region, and that text region, corresponding to the Lula B's antique mall logo, the Lula B's, and this little open sign. Of over there. This example by the actually misses one piece of text. This is very hard to read, but there is actually one piece of text there. That says [xx] are corresponding to this but the aspect ratio looks wrong so we discarded that one. So you know it's ok on this image, but in this particular example the classifier actually missed one piece of text. It's very hard to read because there's a piece of text written against a transparent window. So that's text detection using sliding windows. And having found these rectangles with the text in it, we can now just cut out these image regions and then use later stages of pipeline to try to meet the texts. Now, you recall that the second stage of pipeline was character segmentation, so given an image like that shown on top, how do we segment out the individual characters in this image? So what we can do is again use a supervised learning algorithm with some set of positive and some set of negative examples, what were going to do is look in the image patch and try to decide if there is split between two characters right in the middle of that image match. So for initial positive examples. This first cross example, this image patch looks like the middle of it is indeed the middle has splits between two characters and the second example again this looks like a positive example, because if I split two characters by putting a line right down the middle, that's the right thing to do. So, these are positive examples, where the middle of the image represents a gap or a split between two distinct characters, whereas the negative examples, well, you know, you don't want to split two characters right in the middle, and so these are negative examples because they don't represent the midpoint between two characters. So what we will do is, we will train a classifier, maybe using new network, maybe using a different learning algorithm, to try to classify between the positive and negative examples. Having trained such a classifier, we can then run this on this sort of text that our text detection system has pulled out. As we start by looking at that rectangle, and we ask, "Gee, does it look like the middle of that green rectangle, does it look like the midpoint between two characters?". And hopefully, the classifier will say no, then we slide the window over and this is a one dimensional sliding window classifier, because were going to slide the window only in one straight line from left to right, theres no different rows here. There's only one row here. But now, with the classifier in this position, we ask, well, should we split those two characters or should we put a split right down the middle of this rectangle. And hopefully, the classifier will output y equals one, in which case we will decide to draw a line down there, to try to split two characters. Then we slide the window over again, optic process, don't close the gap, slide over again, optic says yes, do split there and so on, and we slowly slide the classifier over to the right and hopefully it will classify this as another positive example and so on. And we will slide this window over to the right, running the classifier at every step, and hopefully it will tell us, you know, what are the right locations to split these characters up into, just split this image up into individual characters. And so thats 1D sliding windows for character segmentation. So, here's the overall photo OCR pipe line again. In this video we've talked about the text detection step, where we use sliding windows to detect text. And we also use a one-dimensional sliding windows to do character segmentation to segment out, you know, this text image in division of characters. The final step through the pipeline is the character qualification step and that step you might already be much more familiar with the early videos on supervised learning where you can apply a standard supervised learning within maybe on your network or maybe something else in order to take it's input, an image like that and classify which alphabet or which 26 characters A to Z, or maybe we should have 36 characters if you have the numerical digits as well, the multi class classification problem where you take it's input and image contained a character and decide what is the character that appears in that image? So that was the photo OCR pipeline and how you can use ideas like sliding windows classifiers in order to put these different components to develop a photo OCR system. In the next few videos we keep on using the problem of photo OCR to explore somewhat interesting issues surrounding building an application like this.
