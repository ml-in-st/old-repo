1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,430
in this video I want to help you gain an

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:08,010
intuitive understanding of calculus and

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,260
the derivatives now maybe you're

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,480
thinking that you haven't seen calculus

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,519
since your college days and depending on

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,190
when you graduate maybe that was quite

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,650
some time back now if that's what you're

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,990
thinking don't worry you don't need a

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,480
deep understanding of calculus in order

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,180
to apply new networks and deep learning

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,070
very effectively so if you're watching

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,230
this video or some of the later videos

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,520
be wondering wow this stuff really for

14
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,590
me this calculus looks really

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,750
complicated my advice to you is the

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,820
following which is that watch the videos

17
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,350
and then if you could do the homework

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,360
and complete the programming homework

19
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,910
successfully then you can apply deep

20
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,340
learning in fact what you see later is

21
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,170
that in week 4 will define a couple of

22
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,120
types of functions that will enable you

23
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,100
to encapsulate everything that needs to

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,600
be done with respect to calculus that

25
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,190
these functions call forward functions

26
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,500
and backward functions that you learn

27
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,270
about the less you put everything you

28
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,920
need to know about counselors into these

29
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,320
functions so that you don't need to

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,659
worry about them anymore beyond that but

31
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,090
I thought that in this foray into deep

32
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,799
learning that this week we should open

33
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,439
up the box and peer a little bit further

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,760
into the details of calculus but really

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,159
all you need is an intuitive

36
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,780
understanding of this in order to build

37
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,259
and successfully apply these algorithms

38
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,299
oh and finally if you are among that

39
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,979
maybe smaller group of people that are

40
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,229
expert in calculus if you're very

41
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,820
familiar with calculus observe this it's

42
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,460
probably okay for you to skip this video

43
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,650
but for everyone else let's dive in and

44
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,810
try to get an intuitive understanding of

45
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,079
derivatives I've plotted here the

46
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,329
function f of a equals 3/8 so it's just

47
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,159
a straight line to gain intuition about

48
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,560
derivatives let's look at a few points

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,189
on this function let's say that a is

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,820
equal to 2 in that case f of a which is

51
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:56,939
equal to 3 times 8 is equal to 6 so if a

52
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,159
is equal to 2 then you know F of a will

53
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,930
be equal to 6 let's say we give the

54
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,600
value of a you know just a little bit of

55
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,780
a nudge I'm going to just bump up me a

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,670
little bit so there is now 2.00 1 right

57
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,680
so I'm going to get a like a tiny little

58
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:16,040
nudge to the right so now is let's say 2

59
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:20,060
oh one this plug this is to scale 2.01

60
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,230
the 0.001 difference is too small to

61
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,840
show on this plot this give them a

62
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,540
little nudge to the right now f of a is

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,540
equal to three times at so six point

64
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:32,060
zero zero three Simplot this over here

65
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,579
this is not the scale this is six point

66
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:37,280
zero zero three so if you look at this

67
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:40,719
low triangle here some highlighting in

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,299
green what we see is that if I match a

69
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:49,340
0.001 to the right then F of a goes up

70
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:52,040
by 0.03 the amount that F of a went up

71
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,829
is three times as big as the amount that

72
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,189
I judged a to the right so we're going

73
00:02:54,829 --> 00:03:02,870
to say that the slope of the derivative

74
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:05,569
of the function f of a at a equals two

75
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,849
or when a is equal to 2 the slope this

76
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:09,650
reading and you know the term derivative

77
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:11,900
basically means slope is just that

78
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,879
derivative sound like a scary a more

79
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,010
intimidating word whereas slope is a

80
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:17,479
friendlier way to describe the concept

81
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,729
of derivative so one of these year

82
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:22,129
derivative just think slope of the

83
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:26,150
function and more formally the slope is

84
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:28,519
defined as the height divided by the

85
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:31,760
width of this little triangle that we

86
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:35,329
have in green so this is you know 0.03

87
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,310
over 0.01 and the fact that the slope is

88
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:39,859
equal to 3 or the derivative is equal 3

89
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,829
just represents the fact that when you

90
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:45,979
watch a to the right by 0.01 by tiny

91
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:48,739
amount the amount that F of a goes up is

92
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:51,349
three times as big as the amount that

93
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:53,299
United the inertial a in the horizontal

94
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:55,310
direction so that's all that the slope

95
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,439
of a line is now let's look at this

96
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,959
function at a different point let's say

97
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,299
that a is now equal to five

98
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,939
in that case f of a three times a is

99
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:06,169
equal to 15 so let's say I again give a

100
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:08,150
and notch to the right

101
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:10,430
a tiny longnecks is now bumped up to

102
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,180
five point over one F of a is three

103
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,030
times that

104
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:18,079
so f of a is equal to fifteen point zero

105
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:20,779
three and so once again when I bump into

106
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,360
the right not a to the right by 0.001

107
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:27,020
F of a goes up three times as much

108
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,810
so the slope again at a equals five is

109
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:32,449
also three so the way we write is that

110
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:38,389
the slope of the function f is equal to

111
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:40,909
three we say D F of a da and this just

112
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:43,610
means the slope of the function f of a

113
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:46,969
when you nudge the variable a a tiny

114
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:49,909
little amount um this is equal to three

115
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:52,400
and an alternative way to write this

116
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:57,740
derivative formula is as follows you can

117
00:04:52,400 --> 00:05:00,199
also write this as d da of f of a so

118
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,969
whether you put the f of a on top of

119
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,810
whether you write it you know down here

120
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:05,120
it doesn't matter

121
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:08,090
but all those equation means is that if

122
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,940
I nudge a to the right a little bit

123
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:13,400
I expect F of a to go up by three times

124
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:17,270
as much as I not just the value of

125
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:20,029
little a now for this video I explained

126
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:25,729
derivatives talking about what happens

127
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:27,379
we nudge the variable a by 0.001 um if

128
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:28,610
you want the formal mathematical

129
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:31,190
definition of the derivatives

130
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,740
derivatives are defined with an even

131
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:36,909
smaller value of how much energy a to

132
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:42,710
the right so it's not open over 1 is not

133
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:44,960
0.001 is not 0.0 and so on 1 is sort of

134
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:47,360
even smaller than that and the formal

135
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,909
definition of derivative says what have

136
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,379
you nudge a to the right by an info

137
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:54,379
testable amount basically an infinite

138
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:57,319
infinitely tiny tiny amount if you do

139
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:59,240
that does f of a go up three times as

140
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,219
much as whatever was a tiny tiny tiny

141
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,409
amount that you now stay to the right so

142
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:05,870
that's actually the formal definition of

143
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:07,819
a derivative but for the purposes of our

144
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,800
intuitive understanding we're going to

145
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:13,569
talk about nudging a to the right by

146
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,909
this small amount 0.001 even if it's

147
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:19,879
0.001 isn't exactly you know tiny tiny

148
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:22,639
insa testable now one property of the

149
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,529
derivative is that no matter where you

150
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,169
take the slope of this function it is

151
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:30,050
equal to 3 whether a is equal to 2 or a

152
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:33,289
is equal to 5 the slope of this function

153
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,599
is equal to 3 meaning that whatever is

154
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:37,139
the value of a if you increase it by

155
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:39,509
0.001 that

156
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,669
value of f of a goes up by three times

157
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:43,229
as much so this function has the same

158
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:45,569
slope everywhere and one way to see that

159
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:48,689
is that wherever you draw this your

160
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:51,900
little triangle right the height divided

161
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:54,120
by the width always has a ratio of three

162
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,919
to one so I hope this gives you a sense

163
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,840
of what the slope what the derivative of

164
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,879
the function means for a straight line

165
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,639
where in this example the slope of the

166
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,199
function was three everywhere in the

167
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,419
next video let's take a look at a

168
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,310
slightly more complex example where the

169
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:11,479
slopes of the function can be different

170
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,479
at different points on the function
