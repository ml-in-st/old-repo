1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,659
when you implement back-propagation for

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,940
your neural network you need to really

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:08,550
compute the slope or the derivative of

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,440
the activation functions so let's take a

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,840
look at our choices of activation

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,120
functions and how you can compute the

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,880
slope of these functions you can see

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,300
familiar sigmoid activation function and

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,670
so for any given value of z maybe this

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,580
value of z this function will have some

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,980
slope or some derivative corresponding

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,199
to if you draw a rule line there you

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,460
know the height over with there's no

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,890
triangle here so if G of Z is the

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:42,719
sigmoid function then the slope of the

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,750
function is e VZ G of Z and so we know

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:50,610
from calculators that the disss slope of

18
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:52,230
G of X and V and if you are familiar

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,420
with calculus and know how to take

20
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,879
derivatives if you take the derivative

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,309
of the sigmoid function it is possible

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,530
to show that it is equal to this formula

23
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,750
and again I'm not going to do the

24
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,760
calculus steps but if you're familiar

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,340
with calculus do for you to pause the

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:14,430
video and try to prove this yourself and

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:18,030
so this is equal to just G of Z times 1

28
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:21,170
minus G of Z so let's just sanity check

29
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,689
that this expression makes sense

30
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:29,610
first if Z is very large so say Z is

31
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:32,189
equal to 10 then G of Z will be close to

32
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:37,049
1 and so the formula we have on the Left

33
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:42,240
tells us that D DZ G of Z does be close

34
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:45,149
to G of Z which is equal to 1 times 1

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,119
minus 1 which is therefore very close to

36
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,990
0 and this isn't d correct because when

37
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:54,090
Z is very large the slope is close to 0

38
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:57,180
conversely of Z is equal to minus 10 so

39
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,509
there's no way out there then G of Z is

40
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:04,110
close to 0 so the following on the left

41
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:07,140
tells us d DZ G of Z will be close to G

42
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,690
of Z which is 0 times 1 line is 0 and so

43
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,670
this is also very close to 0 which is

44
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,740
correct

45
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:17,610
finally at Z is equal to 0

46
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,040
then G of Z is equal to 1/2 that's a

47
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:25,170
sigmoid function right here and so the

48
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:28,920
derivative is on equal to 1/2 times 1

49
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:31,130
minus 1/2 which is equal to 1/4 and that

50
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,570
actually is turns out to be the correct

51
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,760
value of the derivative or the slope of

52
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,160
this function when Z is equal to 0

53
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,130
finally just to introduce one more piece

54
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,980
of notation sometimes instead of writing

55
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:47,190
this thing the shorthand for the

56
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:51,120
derivative is G prime of Z so G prime of

57
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:53,790
Z in calculus the the little dash on top

58
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,010
is called prime but so G prime of Z is a

59
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,740
shorthand for the in calculus for the

60
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:01,890
derivative of the function of G with

61
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:08,910
respect to the input variable Z um and

62
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:13,350
then in a new network we have a equals G

63
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:18,030
of Z right equals this then this formula

64
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:19,950
also simplifies to a times 1 minus a so

65
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,430
sometimes the implementation you might

66
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:26,400
see something like G prime of Z equals a

67
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,880
times 1 minus a and that just refers to

68
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,340
you know the observation that G prime

69
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,530
which is used derivative is equal to

70
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,360
this over here and the advantage of this

71
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,690
formula is that if you've already

72
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,280
computed the value for a then by using

73
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,040
this expression you can very quickly

74
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,620
compute the value for the slope for G

75
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,930
prime s alright so that was the sigmoid

76
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,720
activation function let's now look at

77
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:54,810
the 10h activation function similar to

78
00:03:51,720 --> 00:04:02,130
what we had previously the definition of

79
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:06,570
d DZ G of Z is the slope of G of Z as a

80
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:09,270
particular point of Z and if you look at

81
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:12,600
the formula for the hyperbolic tangent

82
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:14,430
function and if you know calculus you

83
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,799
can take derivatives and show that this

84
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,799
simplifies to this formula

85
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,830
and using the own shorthand we have

86
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:29,010
previously when we call this G prime of

87
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,900
Z you gain so if you want you can sanity

88
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:34,410
check that this formula make sense so

89
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:38,669
for example if Z is equal to 10 10 H of

90
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:44,639
Z will be very close to 1 this goes from

91
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:46,889
plus 1 to minus 1 and then G prime of Z

92
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,350
according to this formula will be about

93
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:52,320
1 minus 1 squared so during 3 closes

94
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:55,050
zero so that was a Z is very large the

95
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,230
slope is close to zero conversely a Z is

96
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:02,250
very small say Z is equal to minus 10

97
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:05,510
then 10 H of Z will be close to minus 1

98
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:09,570
and so G prime of Z will be close to 1

99
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:12,020
minus negative 1 squared so it's close

100
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:16,350
to 1 minus 1 which is also close to 0

101
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:20,160
and finally is equal to 0 then 10 H of Z

102
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:22,260
is equal to 0 and then the slope is

103
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,750
actually equal to 1 which is which

104
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:28,590
selection the slope point on Z is equal

105
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:31,140
to 0 so just to summarize if a is equal

106
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:34,380
to G of Z so if a is equal to this

107
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:38,370
challenge of Z then the derivative G

108
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:40,620
prime of Z is equal to 1 minus a squared

109
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,020
so once again if you've already computed

110
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,600
the value of a you can use this formula

111
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,789
to very quickly compute the derivative

112
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,350
as well finally here's how you compute

113
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:52,020
the derivatives for the value and

114
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:56,340
looky-loo activation functions for the

115
00:05:52,020 --> 00:06:00,120
value g of z is equal to max of 0 comma

116
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:04,710
Z so the derivative is equal to you

117
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:09,840
turns out to be 0 if Z is less than 0

118
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:11,390
and 1 if Z is greater than 0 and is

119
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,610
actually our undefined

120
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:18,000
technically undefined the G is equal to

121
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:20,130
exactly 0 but um if you're implementing

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,690
this in software it might not be a

123
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:25,169
hundred percent mathematically correct

124
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:27,270
but the work just fine if you V is

125
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:29,580
exactly really zero if you set the

126
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:32,340
derivative to be equal to 1 or this had

127
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,300
to be 0 it kind of doesn't matter if

128
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,490
you're an excellent

129
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,710
nation technically G prime then becomes

130
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,750
what's called a sub gradient of the

131
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,449
activation function G of Z which is why

132
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,699
gradient descent still works but you can

133
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:46,770
think of it as that the chance of Z

134
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,690
being you know zero point exactly those

135
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:51,000
or those of those or zero is so small

136
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,280
that it almost doesn't matter what you

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,349
set the derivative to be equal to when Z

138
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,990
is equal to zero so in practice this is

139
00:06:55,349 --> 00:07:01,259
what people implement for the derivative

140
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:03,060
of Z and finally if you are training on

141
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:07,139
your own network with the we here a Lou

142
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:14,759
activation function then G of Z is going

143
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:20,280
to be max of say 0.01 Z comma Z and so G

144
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:26,280
prime of Z is equal to 0.01 that Z is

145
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:27,900
less than 0 and 1 if Z is greater than 0

146
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,460
and once again the gradient is

147
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,919
technically not defined when Z is

148
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,289
exactly equal to 0 but some maybe

149
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,000
implement a piece of code that sets the

150
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:39,330
derivative or the assess G prime Z

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,039
either a 0.01 or to 1 either way it

152
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,560
doesn't really matter when Z is exactly

153
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,750
0 your co-workers so arms of these

154
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,580
formulas you should either compute the

155
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,490
slopes or the derivatives of your

156
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:52,469
activation assumptions now we have this

157
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,389
building blocks you're ready to see how

158
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:56,159
to implement gradient descent for your

159
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,940
neural network let's go onto the next

160
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,940
video to see that
