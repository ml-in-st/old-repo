00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:03,840
Welcome to the final video of this Machine Learning class.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,473
We've been through a lot of different videos together.

3
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:08,774
In this video I would like to just quickly

4
00:00:08,774 --> 00:00:11,003
summarize the main topics of this course

5
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:13,089
and then say a few words at the end and that

6
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:14,729
will wrap up the class.

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,020
So what have we done?

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,957
In this class we spent a lot of time talking about supervised learning algorithms

9
00:00:21,957 --> 00:00:25,436
like linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, SVMs.

10
00:00:25,436 --> 00:00:29,435
for problems where you have labelled data and labelled examples

11
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:31,300
like x(i), y(i)

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,715
And we also spent quite a lot of time talking about unsupervised learning

13
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:37,344
like K-means clustering,

14
00:00:37,344 --> 00:00:40,316
Principal Components Analysis for dimensionality reduction

15
00:00:40,316 --> 00:00:43,847
and Anomaly Detection algorithms for when you have only

16
00:00:43,847 --> 00:00:46,363
unlabelled data x(i)

17
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:49,378
Although Anomaly Detection can also use some labelled data

18
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:51,189
to evaluate the algorithm.

19
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,725
We also spent some time talking about special applications

20
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:56,407
or special topics like Recommender Systems

21
00:00:56,407 --> 00:00:58,895
and large scale machine learning systems

22
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:01,477
including parallelized and rapid-use systems

23
00:01:01,477 --> 00:01:03,925
as well as some special applications like

24
00:01:03,925 --> 00:01:07,609
sliding windows object classification for computer vision.

25
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,549
And finally we also spent a lot of time talking about different aspects

26
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,198
of, sort of, advice on building a machine learning system.

27
00:01:15,198 --> 00:01:17,264
And this involved both trying to understand

28
00:01:17,264 --> 00:01:19,233
what is it that makes a machine learning algorithm

29
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:20,561
work or not work.

30
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:22,012
So we talked about things like bias and variance,

31
00:01:22,012 --> 00:01:25,479
and how regularization can help with some variance problems.

32
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:28,445
And we also spent a little bit of time talking about

33
00:01:28,445 --> 00:01:32,313
this question of how to decide what to work on next.

34
00:01:32,313 --> 00:01:35,019
So, how to prioritize how you spend your time

35
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:37,513
when you're developing a machine learning system.

36
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:41,044
So we talked about evaluation of learning algorithms,

37
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:44,221
evaluation metrics like  precision recall, F1 score

38
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:47,072
as well as practical aspects of evaluation

39
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:49,898
like the training, cross-validation and test sets.

40
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:52,319
And we also spent a lot of time talking about

41
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,741
debugging learning algorithms and making sure

42
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,212
the learning algorithm is working.

43
00:01:57,212 --> 00:01:59,075
So we talked about diagnostics

44
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:01,999
like learning curves and also talked about things like

45
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:04,394
error analysis and ceiling analysis.

46
00:02:04,394 --> 00:02:08,187
And so all of these were different tools for helping you to decide

47
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:10,349
what to do next and how to spend your valuable

48
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,585
time when you're developing a machine learning system.

49
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:17,665
And in addition to having the tools of machine learning at your disposal

50
00:02:17,665 --> 00:02:20,228
so knowing the tools of machine learning like

51
00:02:20,228 --> 00:02:22,127
supervised learning and unsupervised learning and so on,

52
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:26,015
I hope that you now not only have the tools,

53
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:29,457
but that you know how to apply these tools really well

54
00:02:29,457 --> 00:02:32,658
to build powerful machine learning systems.

55
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:35,556
So, that's it.

56
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,645
Those were the topics of this class

57
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:39,614
and if you worked all the way through this course

58
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:41,308
you should now consider yourself

59
00:02:41,308 --> 00:02:43,511
an expert in machine learning.

60
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:46,879
As you know, machine learning is a technology

61
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,916
that's having huge impact on science, technology and industry.

62
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:53,360
And you're now well qualified to use these tools

63
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,351
of machine learning to great effect.

64
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:57,910
I hope that many of you in this class

65
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,765
will find ways to use machine learning

66
00:02:59,765 --> 00:03:02,324
to build cool systems and cool applications

67
00:03:02,324 --> 00:03:03,946
and cool products.

68
00:03:03,946 --> 00:03:06,084
And I hope that you find ways

69
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:07,930
to use machine learning not only

70
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,762
to make <i>your</i> life better but maybe someday

71
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:14,749
to use it to make many other people's life better as well.

72
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,699
I also wanted to let you know that this class has been great fun for me to teach.

73
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,788
So, thank you for that.

74
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:23,807
And before wrapping up,

75
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:25,282
there's just one last thing I wanted to say.

76
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:28,956
Which is that: It was maybe not so long ago,

77
00:03:28,956 --> 00:03:31,306
that I was a student myself.

78
00:03:31,306 --> 00:03:34,711
And even today, you know, I still try to take different courses

79
00:03:34,711 --> 00:03:36,902
when I have time to try to learn new things.

80
00:03:36,902 --> 00:03:39,989
And so I know how time-consuming it is

81
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:42,273
to learn this stuff.

82
00:03:42,273 --> 00:03:44,663
I know that you're probably a busy person

83
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:47,302
with many, many other things going on in your life.

84
00:03:47,302 --> 00:03:49,838
And so the fact that you still found

85
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:52,431
the time or took the time to watch these videos

86
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:55,799
and, you know, many of these videos just went on

87
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,598
for hours, right?

88
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,068
And the fact many of you took the time

89
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:01,826
to go through the review questions

90
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:03,731
and that many of you took the time

91
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:06,250
to work through the programming exercises.

92
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,483
And these were long and complicate programming exercises.

93
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:12,840
I wanted to say thank you for that.

94
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,920
And I know that many of you have worked hard on this class

95
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,880
and that many of you have put a lot of time into this class,

96
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,396
that many of you have put a lot of yourselves into this class.

97
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:29,292
So I hope that you also got a lot of out this class.

98
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:31,347
And I wanted to say:

99
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:36,423
Thank you very much for having been a student in this class.
